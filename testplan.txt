During the file reading phase, the program needs to successfully read node and link information and store them correctly in an adjacency list. During the path calculation phase, the program needs to perform path calculations for each test case and verify the correctness of the results, while also testing boundary and special cases. During the visualization phase, the program needs to accurately display map information and paths, and be able to adjust the view based on user input. During the map editing phase, the program needs to verify the functionality of adding new paths and changing the properties of existing paths, correctly handle user input errors, and ensure that the edited map can be saved and loaded correctly.

Finally, the program needs to record and analyze test results, improve and optimize the code, and perform checks on code conventions, comments, exception handling, and refactoring to improve code readability and maintainability.
